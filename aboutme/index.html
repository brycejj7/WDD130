    Hey everyone! My name is Bryce and I am currently a Senior here at BYU-I. My wife and I got married in October 2020 and have been
    living here in Rexburg finishing school. I love sports and the outdoors, and have too many guilty pleasures like watching TV and playing
    games. I have the dream to start my own business one day and help as many people as I can. That's why I'm trying to stretch myself and learn 
    really useful skills like programming. I served my mission in Cape Coast, Ghana and recently just quit my job to go back to school full-time.

        <p class="page-1-paragraph-1">Minimalism is a new passion of mine, and I want to help others get started as well.  Getting rid of the clutter of your life and learning to live with less changes our mindset from consumer into producer. Being able to be grateful for what we do have and choosing quality items over quantity will change our satisfaction with everything we use as well. Minimalism can also be used to described aesthetics for homes, offices, web design etc. The same principle of “less is more” is very applicable to our everyday lives. 
            Challenges can include: Minimalism cleanse challenges, Organization, Changing Wardrobe, etc.

            The health topic can go many different directions. From nutritional recipes to workout videos to meditation, gratitude journaling, etc. Our health is our number one wealth. If we take care it, it will take care of us for years to come and will affect every aspect of our lives. No matter the dietary restrictions, allergies, or food dislikes, there are options out there to be able to eat affordable, healthy meals that will help you feel energized and more importantly, heal your gut. Physical exercise can be daunting for those with injury, weight gain, or anyone who does not have it consistently in their schedule. The goal is to help inspire others to find their exercise love: the activity that they enjoy most. The exercise that gets them excited to 
            Get out and move their bodies. Finally mental health. Helping users find their passions and purpose. More than just “travelling to Europe for 3 weeks to find myself”, I want others to understand the light they can bring into the world with their ideas and work. To understand the relationship, they have with themselves is so important, and making taking care of yourself a priority during the hours of the day. Gratitude, and finding belief will be the primary focus of the mental health topics.
